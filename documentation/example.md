Here's a definition list:

apples : Good for making applesauce. oranges : Citrus! tomatoes : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

| Line one | Line too | Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

Inline math equations go in like so: 
ω
=
d
ϕ
/
d
t
. Display math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

I
=
∫
ρ
R
2
d
V

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: `foo`, *bar*, etc.
